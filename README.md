# Portfolio v1

A project portfolio website built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Vuetify 3.0 Beta](https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/).

I built this site to show off some of my Vue projects. I plan to expand it to show off any and all things I work on. For now it is a simple and basic website that does a good enough job of showing off what I want it to.

## TO-DO
- Add calculator to the site,
- Add more pages to separate out the content,
- Add contact form,
- Add Instagram grid
